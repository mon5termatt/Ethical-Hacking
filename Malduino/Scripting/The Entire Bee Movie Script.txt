STRING According to all known laws
ENTER 
STRING of aviation,
ENTER 
STRING there is no way a bee
ENTER 
STRING should be able to fly.
ENTER 
STRING Its wings are too small to get
ENTER 
STRING its fat little body off the ground.
ENTER 
STRING The bee, of course, flies anyway
ENTER 
STRING because bees don't care
ENTER 
STRING what humans think is impossible.
ENTER 
STRING Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
ENTER 
STRING Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
ENTER 
STRING Ooh, black and yellow!
ENTER 
STRING Let's shake it up a little.
ENTER 
STRING Barry! Breakfast is ready!
ENTER 
STRING Coming!
ENTER 
STRING Hang on a second.
ENTER 
STRING Hello?
ENTER 
STRING - Barry?
ENTER 
STRING - Adam?
ENTER 
STRING - Can you believe this is happening?
ENTER 
STRING - I can't. I'll pick you up.
ENTER 
STRING Looking sharp.
ENTER 
STRING Use the stairs. Your father
ENTER 
STRING paid good money for those.
ENTER 
STRING Sorry. I'm excited.
ENTER 
STRING Here's the graduate.
ENTER 
STRING We're very proud of you, son.
ENTER 
STRING A perfect report card, all B's.
ENTER 
STRING Very proud.
ENTER 
STRING Ma! I got a thing going here.
ENTER 
STRING - You got lint on your fuzz.
ENTER 
STRING - Ow! That's me!
ENTER 
STRING - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
ENTER 
STRING - Bye!
ENTER 
STRING Barry, I told you,
ENTER 
STRING stop flying in the house!
ENTER 
STRING - Hey, Adam.
ENTER 
STRING - Hey, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING - Is that fuzz gel?
ENTER 
STRING - A little. Special day, graduation.
ENTER 
STRING Never thought I'd make it.
ENTER 
STRING Three days grade school,
ENTER 
STRING three days high school.
ENTER 
STRING Those were awkward.
ENTER 
STRING Three days college. I'm glad I took
ENTER 
STRING a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
ENTER 
STRING You did come back different.
ENTER 
STRING - Hi, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
ENTER 
STRING - Hear about Frankie?
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING - You going to the funeral?
ENTER 
STRING - No, I'm not going.
ENTER 
STRING Everybody knows,
ENTER 
STRING sting someone, you die.
ENTER 
STRING Don't waste it on a squirrel.
ENTER 
STRING Such a hothead.
ENTER 
STRING I guess he could have
ENTER 
STRING just gotten out of the way.
ENTER 
STRING I love this incorporating
ENTER 
STRING an amusement park into our day.
ENTER 
STRING That's why we don't need vacations.
ENTER 
STRING Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
ENTER 
STRING under the circumstances.
ENTER 
STRING - Well, Adam, today we are men.
ENTER 
STRING - We are!
ENTER 
STRING - Bee-men.
ENTER 
STRING - Amen!
ENTER 
STRING Hallelujah!
ENTER 
STRING Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
ENTER 
STRING please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
ENTER 
STRING Welcome, New Hive City
ENTER 
STRING graduating class of...
ENTER 
STRING ...9:15.
ENTER 
STRING That concludes our ceremonies.
ENTER 
STRING And begins your career
ENTER 
STRING at Honex Industries!
ENTER 
STRING Will we pick ourjob today?
ENTER 
STRING I heard it's just orientation.
ENTER 
STRING Heads up! Here we go.
ENTER 
STRING Keep your hands and antennas
ENTER 
STRING inside the tram at all times.
ENTER 
STRING - Wonder what it'll be like?
ENTER 
STRING - A little scary.
ENTER 
STRING Welcome to Honex,
ENTER 
STRING a division of Honesco
ENTER 
STRING and a part of the Hexagon Group.
ENTER 
STRING This is it!
ENTER 
STRING Wow.
ENTER 
STRING Wow.
ENTER 
STRING We know that you, as a bee,
ENTER 
STRING have worked your whole life
ENTER 
STRING to get to the point where you
ENTER 
STRING can work for your whole life.
ENTER 
STRING Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
ENTER 
STRING Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
ENTER 
STRING Our top-secret formula
ENTER 
STRING is automatically color-corrected,
ENTER 
STRING scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
ENTER 
STRING into this soothing sweet syrup
ENTER 
STRING with its distinctive
ENTER 
STRING golden glow you know as...
ENTER 
STRING Honey!
ENTER 
STRING - That girl was hot.
ENTER 
STRING - She's my cousin!
ENTER 
STRING - She is?
ENTER 
STRING - Yes, we're all cousins.
ENTER 
STRING - Right. You're right.
ENTER 
STRING - At Honex, we constantly strive
ENTER 
STRING to improve every aspect
ENTER 
STRING of bee existence.
ENTER 
STRING These bees are stress-testing
ENTER 
STRING a new helmet technology.
ENTER 
STRING - What do you think he makes?
ENTER 
STRING - Not enough.
ENTER 
STRING Here we have our latest advancement,
ENTER 
STRING the Krelman.
ENTER 
STRING - What does that do?
ENTER 
STRING - Catches that little strand of honey
ENTER 
STRING that hangs after you pour it.
ENTER 
STRING Saves us millions.
ENTER 
STRING Can anyone work on the Krelman?
ENTER 
STRING Of course. Most bee jobs are
ENTER 
STRING small ones. But bees know
ENTER 
STRING that every small job,
ENTER 
STRING if it's done well, means a lot.
ENTER 
STRING But choose carefully
ENTER 
STRING because you'll stay in the job
ENTER 
STRING you pick for the rest of your life.
ENTER 
STRING The same job the rest of your life?
ENTER 
STRING I didn't know that.
ENTER 
STRING What's the difference?
ENTER 
STRING You'll be happy to know that bees,
ENTER 
STRING as a species, haven't had one day off
ENTER 
STRING in 27 million years.
ENTER 
STRING So you'll just work us to death?
ENTER 
STRING We'll sure try.
ENTER 
STRING Wow! That blew my mind!
ENTER 
STRING "What's the difference?"
ENTER 
STRING How can you say that?
ENTER 
STRING One job forever?
ENTER 
STRING That's an insane choice to have to make.
ENTER 
STRING I'm relieved. Now we only have
ENTER 
STRING to make one decision in life.
ENTER 
STRING But, Adam, how could they
ENTER 
STRING never have told us that?
ENTER 
STRING Why would you question anything?
ENTER 
STRING We're bees.
ENTER 
STRING We're the most perfectly
ENTER 
STRING functioning society on Earth.
ENTER 
STRING You ever think maybe things
ENTER 
STRING work a little too well here?
ENTER 
STRING Like what? Give me one example.
ENTER 
STRING I don't know. But you know
ENTER 
STRING what I'm talking about.
ENTER 
STRING Please clear the gate.
ENTER 
STRING Royal Nectar Force on approach.
ENTER 
STRING Wait a second. Check it out.
ENTER 
STRING - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
ENTER 
STRING - Wow.
ENTER 
STRING I've never seen them this close.
ENTER 
STRING They know what it's like
ENTER 
STRING outside the hive.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, but some don't come back.
ENTER 
STRING - Hey, Jocks!
ENTER 
STRING - Hi, Jocks!
ENTER 
STRING You guys did great!
ENTER 
STRING You're monsters!
ENTER 
STRING You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
ENTER 
STRING - I wonder where they were.
ENTER 
STRING - I don't know.
ENTER 
STRING Their day's not planned.
ENTER 
STRING Outside the hive, flying who knows
ENTER 
STRING where, doing who knows what.
ENTER 
STRING You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
ENTER 
STRING Jock. You have to be bred for that.
ENTER 
STRING Right.
ENTER 
STRING Look. That's more pollen
ENTER 
STRING than you and I will see in a lifetime.
ENTER 
STRING It's just a status symbol.
ENTER 
STRING Bees make too much of it.
ENTER 
STRING Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
ENTER 
STRING and the ladies see you wearing it.
ENTER 
STRING Those ladies?
ENTER 
STRING Aren't they our cousins too?
ENTER 
STRING Distant. Distant.
ENTER 
STRING Look at these two.
ENTER 
STRING - Couple of Hive Harrys.
ENTER 
STRING - Let's have fun with them.
ENTER 
STRING It must be dangerous
ENTER 
STRING being a Pollen Jock.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
ENTER 
STRING against a mushroom!
ENTER 
STRING He had a paw on my throat,
ENTER 
STRING and with the other, he was slapping me!
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, my!
ENTER 
STRING - I never thought I'd knock him out.
ENTER 
STRING What were you doing during this?
ENTER 
STRING Trying to alert the authorities.
ENTER 
STRING I can autograph that.
ENTER 
STRING A little gusty out there today,
ENTER 
STRING wasn't it, comrades?
ENTER 
STRING Yeah. Gusty.
ENTER 
STRING We're hitting a sunflower patch
ENTER 
STRING six miles from here tomorrow.
ENTER 
STRING - Six miles, huh?
ENTER 
STRING - Barry!
ENTER 
STRING A puddle jump for us,
ENTER 
STRING but maybe you're not up for it.
ENTER 
STRING - Maybe I am.
ENTER 
STRING - You are not!
ENTER 
STRING We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
ENTER 
STRING What do you think, buzzy-boy?
ENTER 
STRING Are you bee enough?
ENTER 
STRING I might be. It all depends
ENTER 
STRING on what 0900 means.
ENTER 
STRING Hey, Honex!
ENTER 
STRING Dad, you surprised me.
ENTER 
STRING You decide what you're interested in?
ENTER 
STRING - Well, there's a lot of choices.
ENTER 
STRING - But you only get one.
ENTER 
STRING Do you ever get bored
ENTER 
STRING doing the same job every day?
ENTER 
STRING Son, let me tell you about stirring.
ENTER 
STRING You grab that stick, and you just
ENTER 
STRING move it around, and you stir it around.
ENTER 
STRING You get yourself into a rhythm.
ENTER 
STRING It's a beautiful thing.
ENTER 
STRING You know, Dad,
ENTER 
STRING the more I think about it,
ENTER 
STRING maybe the honey field
ENTER 
STRING just isn't right for me.
ENTER 
STRING You were thinking of what,
ENTER 
STRING making balloon animals?
ENTER 
STRING That's a bad job
ENTER 
STRING for a guy with a stinger.
ENTER 
STRING Janet, your son's not sure
ENTER 
STRING he wants to go into honey!
ENTER 
STRING - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
ENTER 
STRING - I'm not trying to be funny.
ENTER 
STRING You're not funny! You're going
ENTER 
STRING into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
ENTER 
STRING - You're gonna be a stirrer?
ENTER 
STRING - No one's listening to me!
ENTER 
STRING Wait till you see the sticks I have.
ENTER 
STRING I could say anything right now.
ENTER 
STRING I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
ENTER 
STRING Let's open some honey and celebrate!
ENTER 
STRING Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
ENTER 
STRING Shave my antennae.
ENTER 
STRING Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
ENTER 
STRING a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
ENTER 
STRING I'm so proud.
ENTER 
STRING - We're starting work today!
ENTER 
STRING - Today's the day.
ENTER 
STRING Come on! All the good jobs
ENTER 
STRING will be gone.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, right.
ENTER 
STRING Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
ENTER 
STRING stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
ENTER 
STRING - Is it still available?
ENTER 
STRING - Hang on. Two left!
ENTER 
STRING One of them's yours! Congratulations!
ENTER 
STRING Step to the side.
ENTER 
STRING - What'd you get?
ENTER 
STRING - Picking crud out. Stellar!
ENTER 
STRING Wow!
ENTER 
STRING Couple of newbies?
ENTER 
STRING Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
ENTER 
STRING Make your choice.
ENTER 
STRING - You want to go first?
ENTER 
STRING - No, you go.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, my. What's available?
ENTER 
STRING Restroom attendant's open,
ENTER 
STRING not for the reason you think.
ENTER 
STRING - Any chance of getting the Krelman?
ENTER 
STRING - Sure, you're on.
ENTER 
STRING I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
ENTER 
STRING Wax monkey's always open.
ENTER 
STRING The Krelman opened up again.
ENTER 
STRING What happened?
ENTER 
STRING A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
ENTER 
STRING He's dead. Another dead one.
ENTER 
STRING Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
ENTER 
STRING Dead from the neck up.
ENTER 
STRING Dead from the neck down. That's life!
ENTER 
STRING Oh, this is so hard!
ENTER 
STRING Heating, cooling,
ENTER 
STRING stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
ENTER 
STRING humming, inspector number seven,
ENTER 
STRING lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
ENTER 
STRING mite wrangler. Barry, what
ENTER 
STRING do you think I should... Barry?
ENTER 
STRING Barry!
ENTER 
STRING All right, we've got the sunflower patch
ENTER 
STRING in quadrant nine...
ENTER 
STRING What happened to you?
ENTER 
STRING Where are you?
ENTER 
STRING - I'm going out.
ENTER 
STRING - Out? Out where?
ENTER 
STRING - Out there.
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, no!
ENTER 
STRING I have to, before I go
ENTER 
STRING to work for the rest of my life.
ENTER 
STRING You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
ENTER 
STRING Another call coming in.
ENTER 
STRING If anyone's feeling brave,
ENTER 
STRING there's a Korean deli on 83rd
ENTER 
STRING that gets their roses today.
ENTER 
STRING Hey, guys.
ENTER 
STRING - Look at that.
ENTER 
STRING - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
ENTER 
STRING Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
ENTER 
STRING It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
ENTER 
STRING Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
ENTER 
STRING Sign here, here. Just initial that.
ENTER 
STRING - Thank you.
ENTER 
STRING - OK.
ENTER 
STRING You got a rain advisory today,
ENTER 
STRING and as you all know,
ENTER 
STRING bees cannot fly in rain.
ENTER 
STRING So be careful. As always,
ENTER 
STRING watch your brooms,
ENTER 
STRING hockey sticks, dogs,
ENTER 
STRING birds, bears and bats.
ENTER 
STRING Also, I got a couple of reports
ENTER 
STRING of root beer being poured on us.
ENTER 
STRING Murphy's in a home because of it,
ENTER 
STRING babbling like a cicada!
ENTER 
STRING - That's awful.
ENTER 
STRING - And a reminder for you rookies,
ENTER 
STRING bee law number one,
ENTER 
STRING absolutely no talking to humans!
ENTER 
STRING All right, launch positions!
ENTER 
STRING Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
ENTER 
STRING buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
ENTER 
STRING Black and yellow!
ENTER 
STRING Hello!
ENTER 
STRING You ready for this, hot shot?
ENTER 
STRING Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
ENTER 
STRING Wind, check.
ENTER 
STRING - Antennae, check.
ENTER 
STRING - Nectar pack, check.
ENTER 
STRING - Wings, check.
ENTER 
STRING - Stinger, check.
ENTER 
STRING Scared out of my shorts, check.
ENTER 
STRING OK, ladies,
ENTER 
STRING let's move it out!
ENTER 
STRING Pound those petunias,
ENTER 
STRING you striped stem-suckers!
ENTER 
STRING All of you, drain those flowers!
ENTER 
STRING Wow! I'm out!
ENTER 
STRING I can't believe I'm out!
ENTER 
STRING So blue.
ENTER 
STRING I feel so fast and free!
ENTER 
STRING Box kite!
ENTER 
STRING Wow!
ENTER 
STRING Flowers!
ENTER 
STRING This is Blue Leader.
ENTER 
STRING We have roses visual.
ENTER 
STRING Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
ENTER 
STRING Roses!
ENTER 
STRING 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
ENTER 
STRING Stand to the side, kid.
ENTER 
STRING It's got a bit of a kick.
ENTER 
STRING That is one nectar collector!
ENTER 
STRING - Ever see pollination up close?
ENTER 
STRING - No, sir.
ENTER 
STRING I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
ENTER 
STRING over here. Maybe a dash over there,
ENTER 
STRING a pinch on that one.
ENTER 
STRING See that? It's a little bit of magic.
ENTER 
STRING That's amazing. Why do we do that?
ENTER 
STRING That's pollen power. More pollen, more
ENTER 
STRING flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
ENTER 
STRING Cool.
ENTER 
STRING I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
ENTER 
STRING Could be daisies. Don't we need those?
ENTER 
STRING Copy that visual.
ENTER 
STRING Wait. One of these flowers
ENTER 
STRING seems to be on the move.
ENTER 
STRING Say again? You're reporting
ENTER 
STRING a moving flower?
ENTER 
STRING Affirmative.
ENTER 
STRING That was on the line!
ENTER 
STRING This is the coolest. What is it?
ENTER 
STRING I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
ENTER 
STRING It smells good.
ENTER 
STRING Not like a flower, but I like it.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, fuzzy.
ENTER 
STRING Chemical-y.
ENTER 
STRING Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
ENTER 
STRING My sweet lord of bees!
ENTER 
STRING Candy-brain, get off there!
ENTER 
STRING Problem!
ENTER 
STRING - Guys!
ENTER 
STRING - This could be bad.
ENTER 
STRING Affirmative.
ENTER 
STRING Very close.
ENTER 
STRING Gonna hurt.
ENTER 
STRING Mama's little boy.
ENTER 
STRING You are way out of position, rookie!
ENTER 
STRING Coming in at you like a missile!
ENTER 
STRING Help me!
ENTER 
STRING I don't think these are flowers.
ENTER 
STRING - Should we tell him?
ENTER 
STRING - I think he knows.
ENTER 
STRING What is this?!
ENTER 
STRING Match point!
ENTER 
STRING You can start packing up, honey,
ENTER 
STRING because you're about to eat it!
ENTER 
STRING Yowser!
ENTER 
STRING Gross.
ENTER 
STRING There's a bee in the car!
ENTER 
STRING - Do something!
ENTER 
STRING - I'm driving!
ENTER 
STRING - Hi, bee.
ENTER 
STRING - He's back here!
ENTER 
STRING He's going to sting me!
ENTER 
STRING Nobody move. If you don't move,
ENTER 
STRING he won't sting you. Freeze!
ENTER 
STRING He blinked!
ENTER 
STRING Spray him, Granny!
ENTER 
STRING What are you doing?!
ENTER 
STRING Wow... the tension level
ENTER 
STRING out here is unbelievable.
ENTER 
STRING I gotta get home.
ENTER 
STRING Can't fly in rain.
ENTER 
STRING Can't fly in rain.
ENTER 
STRING Can't fly in rain.
ENTER 
STRING Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
ENTER 
STRING Ken, could you close
ENTER 
STRING the window please?
ENTER 
STRING Ken, could you close
ENTER 
STRING the window please?
ENTER 
STRING Check out my new resume.
ENTER 
STRING I made it into a fold-out brochure.
ENTER 
STRING You see? Folds out.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
ENTER 
STRING What was that?
ENTER 
STRING Maybe this time. This time. This time.
ENTER 
STRING This time! This time! This...
ENTER 
STRING Drapes!
ENTER 
STRING That is diabolical.
ENTER 
STRING It's fantastic. It's got all my special
ENTER 
STRING skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
ENTER 
STRING What's number one? Star Wars?
ENTER 
STRING Nah, I don't go for that...
ENTER 
STRING ...kind of stuff.
ENTER 
STRING No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
ENTER 
STRING They're out of their minds.
ENTER 
STRING When I leave a job interview, they're
ENTER 
STRING flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
ENTER 
STRING There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
ENTER 
STRING I don't remember the sun
ENTER 
STRING having a big 75 on it.
ENTER 
STRING I predicted global warming.
ENTER 
STRING I could feel it getting hotter.
ENTER 
STRING At first I thought it was just me.
ENTER 
STRING Wait! Stop! Bee!
ENTER 
STRING Stand back. These are winter boots.
ENTER 
STRING Wait!
ENTER 
STRING Don't kill him!
ENTER 
STRING You know I'm allergic to them!
ENTER 
STRING This thing could kill me!
ENTER 
STRING Why does his life have
ENTER 
STRING less value than yours?
ENTER 
STRING Why does his life have any less value
ENTER 
STRING than mine? Is that your statement?
ENTER 
STRING I'm just saying all life has value. You
ENTER 
STRING don't know what he's capable of feeling.
ENTER 
STRING My brochure!
ENTER 
STRING There you go, little guy.
ENTER 
STRING I'm not scared of him.
ENTER 
STRING It's an allergic thing.
ENTER 
STRING Put that on your resume brochure.
ENTER 
STRING My whole face could puff up.
ENTER 
STRING Make it one of your special skills.
ENTER 
STRING Knocking someone out
ENTER 
STRING is also a special skill.
ENTER 
STRING Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
ENTER 
STRING - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
ENTER 
STRING - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
ENTER 
STRING - You could put carob chips on there.
ENTER 
STRING - Bye.
ENTER 
STRING - Supposed to be less calories.
ENTER 
STRING - Bye.
ENTER 
STRING I gotta say something.
ENTER 
STRING She saved my life.
ENTER 
STRING I gotta say something.
ENTER 
STRING All right, here it goes.
ENTER 
STRING Nah.
ENTER 
STRING What would I say?
ENTER 
STRING I could really get in trouble.
ENTER 
STRING It's a bee law.
ENTER 
STRING You're not supposed to talk to a human.
ENTER 
STRING I can't believe I'm doing this.
ENTER 
STRING I've got to.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
ENTER 
STRING No. Yes. No.
ENTER 
STRING Do it. I can't.
ENTER 
STRING How should I start it?
ENTER 
STRING "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
ENTER 
STRING Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
ENTER 
STRING Hi!
ENTER 
STRING I'm sorry.
ENTER 
STRING - You're talking.
ENTER 
STRING - Yes, I know.
ENTER 
STRING You're talking!
ENTER 
STRING I'm so sorry.
ENTER 
STRING No, it's OK. It's fine.
ENTER 
STRING I know I'm dreaming.
ENTER 
STRING But I don't recall going to bed.
ENTER 
STRING Well, I'm sure this
ENTER 
STRING is very disconcerting.
ENTER 
STRING This is a bit of a surprise to me.
ENTER 
STRING I mean, you're a bee!
ENTER 
STRING I am. And I'm not supposed
ENTER 
STRING to be doing this,
ENTER 
STRING but they were all trying to kill me.
ENTER 
STRING And if it wasn't for you...
ENTER 
STRING I had to thank you.
ENTER 
STRING It's just how I was raised.
ENTER 
STRING That was a little weird.
ENTER 
STRING - I'm talking with a bee.
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING I'm talking to a bee.
ENTER 
STRING And the bee is talking to me!
ENTER 
STRING I just want to say I'm grateful.
ENTER 
STRING I'll leave now.
ENTER 
STRING - Wait! How did you learn to do that?
ENTER 
STRING - What?
ENTER 
STRING The talking thing.
ENTER 
STRING Same way you did, I guess.
ENTER 
STRING "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
ENTER 
STRING - That's very funny.
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
ENTER 
STRING we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
ENTER 
STRING Anyway...
ENTER 
STRING Can I...
ENTER 
STRING ...get you something?
ENTER 
STRING - Like what?
ENTER 
STRING I don't know. I mean...
ENTER 
STRING I don't know. Coffee?
ENTER 
STRING I don't want to put you out.
ENTER 
STRING It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
ENTER 
STRING - It's just coffee.
ENTER 
STRING - I hate to impose.
ENTER 
STRING - Don't be ridiculous!
ENTER 
STRING - Actually, I would love a cup.
ENTER 
STRING Hey, you want rum cake?
ENTER 
STRING - I shouldn't.
ENTER 
STRING - Have some.
ENTER 
STRING - No, I can't.
ENTER 
STRING - Come on!
ENTER 
STRING I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
ENTER 
STRING - Where?
ENTER 
STRING - These stripes don't help.
ENTER 
STRING You look great!
ENTER 
STRING I don't know if you know
ENTER 
STRING anything about fashion.
ENTER 
STRING Are you all right?
ENTER 
STRING No.
ENTER 
STRING He's making the tie in the cab
ENTER 
STRING as they're flying up Madison.
ENTER 
STRING He finally gets there.
ENTER 
STRING He runs up the steps into the church.
ENTER 
STRING The wedding is on.
ENTER 
STRING And he says, "Watermelon?
ENTER 
STRING I thought you said Guatemalan.
ENTER 
STRING Why would I marry a watermelon?"
ENTER 
STRING Is that a bee joke?
ENTER 
STRING That's the kind of stuff we do.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, different.
ENTER 
STRING So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
ENTER 
STRING About work? I don't know.
ENTER 
STRING I want to do my part for the hive,
ENTER 
STRING but I can't do it the way they want.
ENTER 
STRING I know how you feel.
ENTER 
STRING - You do?
ENTER 
STRING - Sure.
ENTER 
STRING My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
ENTER 
STRING a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
ENTER 
STRING - Really?
ENTER 
STRING - My only interest is flowers.
ENTER 
STRING Our new queen was just elected
ENTER 
STRING with that same campaign slogan.
ENTER 
STRING Anyway, if you look...
ENTER 
STRING There's my hive right there. See it?
ENTER 
STRING You're in Sheep Meadow!
ENTER 
STRING Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
ENTER 
STRING No way! I know that area.
ENTER 
STRING I lost a toe ring there once.
ENTER 
STRING - Why do girls put rings on their toes?
ENTER 
STRING - Why not?
ENTER 
STRING - It's like putting a hat on your knee.
ENTER 
STRING - Maybe I'll try that.
ENTER 
STRING - You all right, ma'am?
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, yeah. Fine.
ENTER 
STRING Just having two cups of coffee!
ENTER 
STRING Anyway, this has been great.
ENTER 
STRING Thanks for the coffee.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, it's no trouble.
ENTER 
STRING Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
ENTER 
STRING I'd be up the rest of my life.
ENTER 
STRING Are you...?
ENTER 
STRING Can I take a piece of this with me?
ENTER 
STRING Sure! Here, have a crumb.
ENTER 
STRING - Thanks!
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING All right. Well, then...
ENTER 
STRING I guess I'll see you around.
ENTER 
STRING Or not.
ENTER 
STRING OK, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING And thank you
ENTER 
STRING so much again... for before.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, that? That was nothing.
ENTER 
STRING Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
ENTER 
STRING This can't possibly work.
ENTER 
STRING He's all set to go.
ENTER 
STRING We may as well try it.
ENTER 
STRING OK, Dave, pull the chute.
ENTER 
STRING - Sounds amazing.
ENTER 
STRING - It was amazing!
ENTER 
STRING It was the scariest,
ENTER 
STRING happiest moment of my life.
ENTER 
STRING Humans! I can't believe
ENTER 
STRING you were with humans!
ENTER 
STRING Giant, scary humans!
ENTER 
STRING What were they like?
ENTER 
STRING Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
ENTER 
STRING They eat crazy giant things.
ENTER 
STRING They drive crazy.
ENTER 
STRING - Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
ENTER 
STRING - Some of them. But some of them don't.
ENTER 
STRING - How'd you get back?
ENTER 
STRING - Poodle.
ENTER 
STRING You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
ENTER 
STRING whatever you wanted to see.
ENTER 
STRING You had your "experience." Now you
ENTER 
STRING can pick out yourjob and be normal.
ENTER 
STRING - Well...
ENTER 
STRING - Well?
ENTER 
STRING Well, I met someone.
ENTER 
STRING You did? Was she Bee-ish?
ENTER 
STRING - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
ENTER 
STRING - No, no, no, not a wasp.
ENTER 
STRING - Spider?
ENTER 
STRING - I'm not attracted to spiders.
ENTER 
STRING I know it's the hottest thing,
ENTER 
STRING with the eight legs and all.
ENTER 
STRING I can't get by that face.
ENTER 
STRING So who is she?
ENTER 
STRING She's... human.
ENTER 
STRING No, no. That's a bee law.
ENTER 
STRING You wouldn't break a bee law.
ENTER 
STRING - Her name's Vanessa.
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, boy.
ENTER 
STRING She's so nice. And she's a florist!
ENTER 
STRING Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
ENTER 
STRING We're not dating.
ENTER 
STRING You're flying outside the hive, talking
ENTER 
STRING to humans that attack our homes
ENTER 
STRING with power washers and M-80s!
ENTER 
STRING One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
ENTER 
STRING She saved my life!
ENTER 
STRING And she understands me.
ENTER 
STRING This is over!
ENTER 
STRING Eat this.
ENTER 
STRING This is not over! What was that?
ENTER 
STRING - They call it a crumb.
ENTER 
STRING - It was so stingin' stripey!
ENTER 
STRING And that's not what they eat.
ENTER 
STRING That's what falls off what they eat!
ENTER 
STRING - You know what a Cinnabon is?
ENTER 
STRING - No.
ENTER 
STRING It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
ENTER 
STRING They heat it up...
ENTER 
STRING Sit down!
ENTER 
STRING ...really hot!
ENTER 
STRING - Listen to me!
ENTER 
STRING We are not them! We're us.
ENTER 
STRING There's us and there's them!
ENTER 
STRING Yes, but who can deny
ENTER 
STRING the heart that is yearning?
ENTER 
STRING There's no yearning.
ENTER 
STRING Stop yearning. Listen to me!
ENTER 
STRING You have got to start thinking bee,
ENTER 
STRING my friend. Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING - Thinking bee.
ENTER 
STRING - Thinking bee.
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING There he is. He's in the pool.
ENTER 
STRING You know what your problem is, Barry?
ENTER 
STRING I gotta start thinking bee?
ENTER 
STRING How much longer will this go on?
ENTER 
STRING It's been three days!
ENTER 
STRING Why aren't you working?
ENTER 
STRING I've got a lot of big life decisions
ENTER 
STRING to think about.
ENTER 
STRING What life? You have no life!
ENTER 
STRING You have no job. You're barely a bee!
ENTER 
STRING Would it kill you
ENTER 
STRING to make a little honey?
ENTER 
STRING Barry, come out.
ENTER 
STRING Your father's talking to you.
ENTER 
STRING Martin, would you talk to him?
ENTER 
STRING Barry, I'm talking to you!
ENTER 
STRING You coming?
ENTER 
STRING Got everything?
ENTER 
STRING All set!
ENTER 
STRING Go ahead. I'll catch up.
ENTER 
STRING Don't be too long.
ENTER 
STRING Watch this!
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa!
ENTER 
STRING - We're still here.
ENTER 
STRING - I told you not to yell at him.
ENTER 
STRING He doesn't respond to yelling!
ENTER 
STRING - Then why yell at me?
ENTER 
STRING - Because you don't listen!
ENTER 
STRING I'm not listening to this.
ENTER 
STRING Sorry, I've gotta go.
ENTER 
STRING - Where are you going?
ENTER 
STRING - I'm meeting a friend.
ENTER 
STRING A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
ENTER 
STRING Bye.
ENTER 
STRING I just hope she's Bee-ish.
ENTER 
STRING They have a huge parade
ENTER 
STRING of flowers every year in Pasadena?
ENTER 
STRING To be in the Tournament of Roses,
ENTER 
STRING that's every florist's dream!
ENTER 
STRING Up on a float, surrounded
ENTER 
STRING by flowers, crowds cheering.
ENTER 
STRING A tournament. Do the roses
ENTER 
STRING compete in athletic events?
ENTER 
STRING No. All right, I've got one.
ENTER 
STRING How come you don't fly everywhere?
ENTER 
STRING It's exhausting. Why don't you
ENTER 
STRING run everywhere? It's faster.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
ENTER 
STRING All right, your turn.
ENTER 
STRING TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
ENTER 
STRING That's insane!
ENTER 
STRING You don't have that?
ENTER 
STRING We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
ENTER 
STRING It's a horrible, horrible disease.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, my.
ENTER 
STRING Dumb bees!
ENTER 
STRING You must want to sting all those jerks.
ENTER 
STRING We try not to sting.
ENTER 
STRING It's usually fatal for us.
ENTER 
STRING So you have to watch your temper.
ENTER 
STRING Very carefully.
ENTER 
STRING You kick a wall, take a walk,
ENTER 
STRING write an angry letter and throw it out.
ENTER 
STRING Work through it like any emotion:
ENTER 
STRING Anger, jealousy, lust.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
ENTER 
STRING Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING - What is wrong with you?!
ENTER 
STRING - It's a bug.
ENTER 
STRING He's not bothering anybody.
ENTER 
STRING Get out of here, you creep!
ENTER 
STRING What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, it was. How did you know?
ENTER 
STRING It felt like about 10 pages.
ENTER 
STRING Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
ENTER 
STRING You've really got that
ENTER 
STRING down to a science.
ENTER 
STRING - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
ENTER 
STRING - I'll bet.
ENTER 
STRING What in the name
ENTER 
STRING of Mighty Hercules is this?
ENTER 
STRING How did this get here?
ENTER 
STRING Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,
ENTER 
STRING Ray Liotta Private Select?
ENTER 
STRING - Is he that actor?
ENTER 
STRING - I never heard of him.
ENTER 
STRING - Why is this here?
ENTER 
STRING - For people. We eat it.
ENTER 
STRING You don't have
ENTER 
STRING enough food of your own?
ENTER 
STRING - Well, yes.
ENTER 
STRING - How do you get it?
ENTER 
STRING - Bees make it.
ENTER 
STRING - I know who makes it!
ENTER 
STRING And it's hard to make it!
ENTER 
STRING There's heating, cooling, stirring.
ENTER 
STRING You need a whole Krelman thing!
ENTER 
STRING - It's organic.
ENTER 
STRING - It's our-ganic!
ENTER 
STRING It's just honey, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING Just what?!
ENTER 
STRING Bees don't know about this!
ENTER 
STRING This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
ENTER 
STRING You've taken our homes, schools,
ENTER 
STRING hospitals! This is all we have!
ENTER 
STRING And it's on sale?!
ENTER 
STRING I'm getting to the bottom of this.
ENTER 
STRING I'm getting to the bottom
ENTER 
STRING of all of this!
ENTER 
STRING Hey, Hector.
ENTER 
STRING - You almost done?
ENTER 
STRING - Almost.
ENTER 
STRING He is here. I sense it.
ENTER 
STRING Well, I guess I'll go home now
ENTER 
STRING and just leave this nice honey out,
ENTER 
STRING with no one around.
ENTER 
STRING You're busted, box boy!
ENTER 
STRING I knew I heard something.
ENTER 
STRING So you can talk!
ENTER 
STRING I can talk.
ENTER 
STRING And now you'll start talking!
ENTER 
STRING Where you getting the sweet stuff?
ENTER 
STRING Who's your supplier?
ENTER 
STRING I don't understand.
ENTER 
STRING I thought we were friends.
ENTER 
STRING The last thing we want
ENTER 
STRING to do is upset bees!
ENTER 
STRING You're too late! It's ours now!
ENTER 
STRING You, sir, have crossed
ENTER 
STRING the wrong sword!
ENTER 
STRING You, sir, will be lunch
ENTER 
STRING for my iguana, Ignacio!
ENTER 
STRING Where is the honey coming from?
ENTER 
STRING Tell me where!
ENTER 
STRING Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
ENTER 
STRING Crazy person!
ENTER 
STRING What horrible thing has happened here?
ENTER 
STRING These faces, they never knew
ENTER 
STRING what hit them. And now
ENTER 
STRING they're on the road to nowhere!
ENTER 
STRING Just keep still.
ENTER 
STRING What? You're not dead?
ENTER 
STRING Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
ENTER 
STRING that moves. Where you headed?
ENTER 
STRING To Honey Farms.
ENTER 
STRING I am onto something huge here.
ENTER 
STRING I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
ENTER 
STRING crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
ENTER 
STRING I'm going to Tacoma.
ENTER 
STRING - And you?
ENTER 
STRING - He really is dead.
ENTER 
STRING All right.
ENTER 
STRING Uh-oh!
ENTER 
STRING - What is that?!
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, no!
ENTER 
STRING - A wiper! Triple blade!
ENTER 
STRING - Triple blade?
ENTER 
STRING Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
ENTER 
STRING Why does everything have
ENTER 
STRING to be so doggone clean?!
ENTER 
STRING How much do you people need to see?!
ENTER 
STRING Open your eyes!
ENTER 
STRING Stick your head out the window!
ENTER 
STRING From NPR News in Washington,
ENTER 
STRING I'm Carl Kasell.
ENTER 
STRING But don't kill no more bugs!
ENTER 
STRING - Bee!
ENTER 
STRING - Moose blood guy!!
ENTER 
STRING - You hear something?
ENTER 
STRING - Like what?
ENTER 
STRING Like tiny screaming.
ENTER 
STRING Turn off the radio.
ENTER 
STRING Whassup, bee boy?
ENTER 
STRING Hey, Blood.
ENTER 
STRING Just a row of honey jars,
ENTER 
STRING as far as the eye could see.
ENTER 
STRING Wow!
ENTER 
STRING I assume wherever this truck goes
ENTER 
STRING is where they're getting it.
ENTER 
STRING I mean, that honey's ours.
ENTER 
STRING - Bees hang tight.
ENTER 
STRING - We're all jammed in.
ENTER 
STRING It's a close community.
ENTER 
STRING Not us, man. We on our own.
ENTER 
STRING Every mosquito on his own.
ENTER 
STRING - What if you get in trouble?
ENTER 
STRING - You a mosquito, you in trouble.
ENTER 
STRING Nobody likes us. They just smack.
ENTER 
STRING See a mosquito, smack, smack!
ENTER 
STRING At least you're out in the world.
ENTER 
STRING You must meet girls.
ENTER 
STRING Mosquito girls try to trade up,
ENTER 
STRING get with a moth, dragonfly.
ENTER 
STRING Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
ENTER 
STRING You got to be kidding me!
ENTER 
STRING Mooseblood's about to leave
ENTER 
STRING the building! So long, bee!
ENTER 
STRING - Hey, guys!
ENTER 
STRING - Mooseblood!
ENTER 
STRING I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
ENTER 
STRING Did you bring your crazy straw?
ENTER 
STRING We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
ENTER 
STRING and it's pretty much pure profit.
ENTER 
STRING What is this place?
ENTER 
STRING A bee's got a brain
ENTER 
STRING the size of a pinhead.
ENTER 
STRING They are pinheads!
ENTER 
STRING Pinhead.
ENTER 
STRING - Check out the new smoker.
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
ENTER 
STRING The Thomas 3000!
ENTER 
STRING Smoker?
ENTER 
STRING Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
ENTER 
STRING Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
ENTER 
STRING A couple breaths of this
ENTER 
STRING knocks them right out.
ENTER 
STRING They make the honey,
ENTER 
STRING and we make the money.
ENTER 
STRING "They make the honey,
ENTER 
STRING and we make the money"?
ENTER 
STRING Oh, my!
ENTER 
STRING What's going on? Are you OK?
ENTER 
STRING Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
ENTER 
STRING Do you know you're
ENTER 
STRING in a fake hive with fake walls?
ENTER 
STRING Our queen was moved here.
ENTER 
STRING We had no choice.
ENTER 
STRING This is your queen?
ENTER 
STRING That's a man in women's clothes!
ENTER 
STRING That's a drag queen!
ENTER 
STRING What is this?
ENTER 
STRING Oh, no!
ENTER 
STRING There's hundreds of them!
ENTER 
STRING Bee honey.
ENTER 
STRING Our honey is being brazenly stolen
ENTER 
STRING on a massive scale!
ENTER 
STRING This is worse than anything bears
ENTER 
STRING have done! I intend to do something.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, Barry, stop.
ENTER 
STRING Who told you humans are taking
ENTER 
STRING our honey? That's a rumor.
ENTER 
STRING Do these look like rumors?
ENTER 
STRING That's a conspiracy theory.
ENTER 
STRING These are obviously doctored photos.
ENTER 
STRING How did you get mixed up in this?
ENTER 
STRING He's been talking to humans.
ENTER 
STRING - What?
ENTER 
STRING - Talking to humans?!
ENTER 
STRING He has a human girlfriend.
ENTER 
STRING And they make out!
ENTER 
STRING Make out? Barry!
ENTER 
STRING We do not.
ENTER 
STRING - You wish you could.
ENTER 
STRING - Whose side are you on?
ENTER 
STRING The bees!
ENTER 
STRING I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
ENTER 
STRING Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, this is what you want
ENTER 
STRING to do with your life?
ENTER 
STRING I want to do it for all our lives.
ENTER 
STRING Nobody works harder than bees!
ENTER 
STRING Dad, I remember you
ENTER 
STRING coming home so overworked
ENTER 
STRING your hands were still stirring.
ENTER 
STRING You couldn't stop.
ENTER 
STRING I remember that.
ENTER 
STRING What right do they have to our honey?
ENTER 
STRING We live on two cups a year. They put it
ENTER 
STRING in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
ENTER 
STRING Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
ENTER 
STRING Sting them where it really hurts.
ENTER 
STRING In the face! The eye!
ENTER 
STRING - That would hurt.
ENTER 
STRING - No.
ENTER 
STRING Up the nose? That's a killer.
ENTER 
STRING There's only one place you can sting
ENTER 
STRING the humans, one place where it matters.
ENTER 
STRING Hive at Five, the hive's only
ENTER 
STRING full-hour action news source.
ENTER 
STRING No more bee beards!
ENTER 
STRING With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
ENTER 
STRING Weather with Storm Stinger.
ENTER 
STRING Sports with Buzz Larvi.
ENTER 
STRING And Jeanette Chung.
ENTER 
STRING - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
ENTER 
STRING - And I'm Jeanette Chung.
ENTER 
STRING A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
ENTER 
STRING intends to sue the human race
ENTER 
STRING for stealing our honey,
ENTER 
STRING packaging it and profiting
ENTER 
STRING from it illegally!
ENTER 
STRING Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
ENTER 
STRING we'll have three former queens here in
ENTER 
STRING our studio, discussing their new book,
ENTER 
STRING Classy Ladies,
ENTER 
STRING out this week on Hexagon.
ENTER 
STRING Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
ENTER 
STRING Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
ENTER 
STRING from the hive. I can't do this"?
ENTER 
STRING Bees have never been afraid
ENTER 
STRING to change the world.
ENTER 
STRING What about Bee Columbus?
ENTER 
STRING Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
ENTER 
STRING Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
ENTER 
STRING We were thinking
ENTER 
STRING of stickball or candy stores.
ENTER 
STRING How old are you?
ENTER 
STRING The bee community
ENTER 
STRING is supporting you in this case,
ENTER 
STRING which will be the trial
ENTER 
STRING of the bee century.
ENTER 
STRING You know, they have a Larry King
ENTER 
STRING in the human world too.
ENTER 
STRING It's a common name. Next week...
ENTER 
STRING He looks like you and has a show
ENTER 
STRING and suspenders and colored dots...
ENTER 
STRING Next week...
ENTER 
STRING Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
ENTER 
STRING guest even though you just heard 'em.
ENTER 
STRING Bear Week next week!
ENTER 
STRING They're scary, hairy and here live.
ENTER 
STRING Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
ENTER 
STRING squinty eyes, very Jewish.
ENTER 
STRING In tennis, you attack
ENTER 
STRING at the point of weakness!
ENTER 
STRING It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
ENTER 
STRING Honey, her backhand's a joke!
ENTER 
STRING I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
ENTER 
STRING Quiet, please.
ENTER 
STRING Actual work going on here.
ENTER 
STRING - Is that that same bee?
ENTER 
STRING - Yes, it is!
ENTER 
STRING I'm helping him sue the human race.
ENTER 
STRING - Hello.
ENTER 
STRING - Hello, bee.
ENTER 
STRING This is Ken.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ENTER 
STRING ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
ENTER 
STRING Why does he talk again?
ENTER 
STRING Listen, you better go
ENTER 
STRING 'cause we're really busy working.
ENTER 
STRING But it's our yogurt night!
ENTER 
STRING Bye-bye.
ENTER 
STRING Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
ENTER 
STRING You poor thing.
ENTER 
STRING You two have been at this for hours!
ENTER 
STRING Yes, and Adam here
ENTER 
STRING has been a huge help.
ENTER 
STRING - Frosting...
ENTER 
STRING - How many sugars?
ENTER 
STRING Just one. I try not
ENTER 
STRING to use the competition.
ENTER 
STRING So why are you helping me?
ENTER 
STRING Bees have good qualities.
ENTER 
STRING And it takes my mind off the shop.
ENTER 
STRING Instead of flowers, people
ENTER 
STRING are giving balloon bouquets now.
ENTER 
STRING Those are great, if you're three.
ENTER 
STRING And artificial flowers.
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, those just get me psychotic!
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah, me too.
ENTER 
STRING Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
ENTER 
STRING Bees must hate those fake things!
ENTER 
STRING Nothing worse
ENTER 
STRING than a daffodil that's had work done.
ENTER 
STRING Maybe this could make up
ENTER 
STRING for it a little bit.
ENTER 
STRING - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
ENTER 
STRING - I guess.
ENTER 
STRING You sure you want to go through with it?
ENTER 
STRING Am I sure? When I'm done with
ENTER 
STRING the humans, they won't be able
ENTER 
STRING to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
ENTER 
STRING without paying a royalty!
ENTER 
STRING It's an incredible scene
ENTER 
STRING here in downtown Manhattan,
ENTER 
STRING where the world anxiously waits,
ENTER 
STRING because for the first time in history,
ENTER 
STRING we will hear for ourselves
ENTER 
STRING if a honeybee can actually speak.
ENTER 
STRING What have we gotten into here, Barry?
ENTER 
STRING It's pretty big, isn't it?
ENTER 
STRING I can't believe how many humans
ENTER 
STRING don't work during the day.
ENTER 
STRING You think billion-dollar multinational
ENTER 
STRING food companies have good lawyers?
ENTER 
STRING Everybody needs to stay
ENTER 
STRING behind the barricade.
ENTER 
STRING - What's the matter?
ENTER 
STRING - I don't know, I just got a chill.
ENTER 
STRING Well, if it isn't the bee team.
ENTER 
STRING You boys work on this?
ENTER 
STRING All rise! The Honorable
ENTER 
STRING Judge Bumbleton presiding.
ENTER 
STRING All right. Case number 4475,
ENTER 
STRING Superior Court of New York,
ENTER 
STRING Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
ENTER 
STRING is now in session.
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
ENTER 
STRING the five food companies collectively?
ENTER 
STRING A privilege.
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Benson... you're representing
ENTER 
STRING all the bees of the world?
ENTER 
STRING I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
ENTER 
STRING we're ready to proceed.
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Montgomery,
ENTER 
STRING your opening statement, please.
ENTER 
STRING Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
ENTER 
STRING my grandmother was a simple woman.
ENTER 
STRING Born on a farm, she believed
ENTER 
STRING it was man's divine right
ENTER 
STRING to benefit from the bounty
ENTER 
STRING of nature God put before us.
ENTER 
STRING If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Benson imagines,
ENTER 
STRING just think of what would it mean.
ENTER 
STRING I would have to negotiate
ENTER 
STRING with the silkworm
ENTER 
STRING for the elastic in my britches!
ENTER 
STRING Talking bee!
ENTER 
STRING How do we know this isn't some sort of
ENTER 
STRING holographic motion-picture-capture
ENTER 
STRING Hollywood wizardry?
ENTER 
STRING They could be using laser beams!
ENTER 
STRING Robotics! Ventriloquism!
ENTER 
STRING Cloning! For all we know,
ENTER 
STRING he could be on steroids!
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Benson?
ENTER 
STRING Ladies and gentlemen,
ENTER 
STRING there's no trickery here.
ENTER 
STRING I'm just an ordinary bee.
ENTER 
STRING Honey's pretty important to me.
ENTER 
STRING It's important to all bees.
ENTER 
STRING We invented it!
ENTER 
STRING We make it. And we protect it
ENTER 
STRING with our lives.
ENTER 
STRING Unfortunately, there are
ENTER 
STRING some people in this room
ENTER 
STRING who think they can take it from us
ENTER 
STRING 'cause we're the little guys!
ENTER 
STRING I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
ENTER 
STRING you'll see how, by taking our honey,
ENTER 
STRING you not only take everything we have
ENTER 
STRING but everything we are!
ENTER 
STRING I wish he'd dress like that
ENTER 
STRING all the time. So nice!
ENTER 
STRING Call your first witness.
ENTER 
STRING So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
ENTER 
STRING of Honey Farms, big company you have.
ENTER 
STRING I suppose so.
ENTER 
STRING I see you also own
ENTER 
STRING Honeyburton and Honron!
ENTER 
STRING Yes, they provide beekeepers
ENTER 
STRING for our farms.
ENTER 
STRING Beekeeper. I find that
ENTER 
STRING to be a very disturbing term.
ENTER 
STRING I don't imagine you employ
ENTER 
STRING any bee-free-ers, do you?
ENTER 
STRING - No.
ENTER 
STRING - I couldn't hear you.
ENTER 
STRING - No.
ENTER 
STRING - No.
ENTER 
STRING Because you don't free bees.
ENTER 
STRING You keep bees. Not only that,
ENTER 
STRING it seems you thought a bear would be
ENTER 
STRING an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
ENTER 
STRING They're very lovable creatures.
ENTER 
STRING Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
ENTER 
STRING You mean like this?
ENTER 
STRING Bears kill bees!
ENTER 
STRING How'd you like his head crashing
ENTER 
STRING through your living room?!
ENTER 
STRING Biting into your couch!
ENTER 
STRING Spitting out your throw pillows!
ENTER 
STRING OK, that's enough. Take him away.
ENTER 
STRING So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
ENTER 
STRING Your name intrigues me.
ENTER 
STRING - Where have I heard it before?
ENTER 
STRING - I was with a band called The Police.
ENTER 
STRING But you've never been
ENTER 
STRING a police officer, have you?
ENTER 
STRING No, I haven't.
ENTER 
STRING No, you haven't. And so here
ENTER 
STRING we have yet another example
ENTER 
STRING of bee culture casually
ENTER 
STRING stolen by a human
ENTER 
STRING for nothing more than
ENTER 
STRING a prance-about stage name.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, please.
ENTER 
STRING Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
ENTER 
STRING Because I'm feeling
ENTER 
STRING a little stung, Sting.
ENTER 
STRING Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
ENTER 
STRING That's not his real name?! You idiots!
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Liotta, first,
ENTER 
STRING belated congratulations on
ENTER 
STRING your Emmy win for a guest spot
ENTER 
STRING on ER in 2005.
ENTER 
STRING Thank you. Thank you.
ENTER 
STRING I see from your resume
ENTER 
STRING that you're devilishly handsome
ENTER 
STRING with a churning inner turmoil
ENTER 
STRING that's ready to blow.
ENTER 
STRING I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
ENTER 
STRING Not yet it isn't. But is this
ENTER 
STRING what it's come to for you?
ENTER 
STRING Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
ENTER 
STRING so you don't
ENTER 
STRING have to rehearse
ENTER 
STRING your part and learn your lines, sir?
ENTER 
STRING Watch it, Benson!
ENTER 
STRING I could blow right now!
ENTER 
STRING This isn't a goodfella.
ENTER 
STRING This is a badfella!
ENTER 
STRING Why doesn't someone just step on
ENTER 
STRING this creep, and we can all go home?!
ENTER 
STRING - Order in this court!
ENTER 
STRING - You're all thinking it!
ENTER 
STRING Order! Order, I say!
ENTER 
STRING - Say it!
ENTER 
STRING - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
ENTER 
STRING I think it was awfully nice
ENTER 
STRING of that bear to pitch in like that.
ENTER 
STRING I think the jury's on our side.
ENTER 
STRING Are we doing everything right, legally?
ENTER 
STRING I'm a florist.
ENTER 
STRING Right. Well, here's to a great team.
ENTER 
STRING To a great team!
ENTER 
STRING Well, hello.
ENTER 
STRING - Ken!
ENTER 
STRING - Hello.
ENTER 
STRING I didn't think you were coming.
ENTER 
STRING No, I was just late.
ENTER 
STRING I tried to call, but... the battery.
ENTER 
STRING I didn't want all this to go to waste,
ENTER 
STRING so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, that was lucky.
ENTER 
STRING There's a little left.
ENTER 
STRING I could heat it up.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
ENTER 
STRING So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
ENTER 
STRING I'm not much for the game myself.
ENTER 
STRING The ball's a little grabby.
ENTER 
STRING That's where I usually sit.
ENTER 
STRING Right... there.
ENTER 
STRING Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
ENTER 
STRING and he agreed with me that eating with
ENTER 
STRING chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
ENTER 
STRING You think I don't see what you're doing?
ENTER 
STRING I know how hard it is to find
ENTER 
STRING the rightjob. We have that in common.
ENTER 
STRING Do we?
ENTER 
STRING Bees have 100 percent employment,
ENTER 
STRING but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
ENTER 
STRING That's just what
ENTER 
STRING I was thinking about doing.
ENTER 
STRING Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
ENTER 
STRING for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
ENTER 
STRING I'm going to drain the old stinger.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah, you do that.
ENTER 
STRING Look at that.
ENTER 
STRING You know, I've just about had it
ENTER 
STRING with your little mind games.
ENTER 
STRING - What's that?
ENTER 
STRING - Italian Vogue.
ENTER 
STRING Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
ENTER 
STRING A lot of ads.
ENTER 
STRING Remember what Van said, why is
ENTER 
STRING your life more valuable than mine?
ENTER 
STRING Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
ENTER 
STRING I think something stinks in here!
ENTER 
STRING I love the smell of flowers.
ENTER 
STRING How do you like the smell of flames?!
ENTER 
STRING Not as much.
ENTER 
STRING Water bug! Not taking sides!
ENTER 
STRING Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
ENTER 
STRING This is pathetic!
ENTER 
STRING I've got issues!
ENTER 
STRING Well, well, well, a royal flush!
ENTER 
STRING - You're bluffing.
ENTER 
STRING - Am I?
ENTER 
STRING Surf's up, dude!
ENTER 
STRING Poo water!
ENTER 
STRING That bowl is gnarly.
ENTER 
STRING Except for those dirty yellow rings!
ENTER 
STRING Kenneth! What are you doing?!
ENTER 
STRING You know, I don't even like honey!
ENTER 
STRING I don't eat it!
ENTER 
STRING We need to talk!
ENTER 
STRING He's just a little bee!
ENTER 
STRING And he happens to be
ENTER 
STRING the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
ENTER 
STRING Long time? What are you talking about?!
ENTER 
STRING Are there other bugs in your life?
ENTER 
STRING No, but there are other things bugging
ENTER 
STRING me in life. And you're one of them!
ENTER 
STRING Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
ENTER 
STRING My nerves are fried from riding
ENTER 
STRING on this emotional roller coaster!
ENTER 
STRING Goodbye, Ken.
ENTER 
STRING And for your information,
ENTER 
STRING I prefer sugar-free, artificial
ENTER 
STRING sweeteners made by man!
ENTER 
STRING I'm sorry about all that.
ENTER 
STRING I know it's got
ENTER 
STRING an aftertaste! I like it!
ENTER 
STRING I always felt there was some kind
ENTER 
STRING of barrier between Ken and me.
ENTER 
STRING I couldn't overcome it.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, well.
ENTER 
STRING Are you OK for the trial?
ENTER 
STRING I believe Mr. Montgomery
ENTER 
STRING is about out of ideas.
ENTER 
STRING We would like to call
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
ENTER 
STRING Good idea! You can really see why he's
ENTER 
STRING considered one of the best lawyers...
ENTER 
STRING Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING Layton, you've
ENTER 
STRING gotta weave some magic
ENTER 
STRING with this jury,
ENTER 
STRING or it's gonna be all over.
ENTER 
STRING Don't worry. The only thing I have
ENTER 
STRING to do to turn this jury around
ENTER 
STRING is to remind them
ENTER 
STRING of what they don't like about bees.
ENTER 
STRING - You got the tweezers?
ENTER 
STRING - Are you allergic?
ENTER 
STRING Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
ENTER 
STRING what I think we'd all like to know.
ENTER 
STRING What exactly is your relationship
ENTER 
STRING to that woman?
ENTER 
STRING We're friends.
ENTER 
STRING - Good friends?
ENTER 
STRING - Yes.
ENTER 
STRING How good? Do you live together?
ENTER 
STRING Wait a minute...
ENTER 
STRING Are you her little...
ENTER 
STRING ...bedbug?
ENTER 
STRING I've seen a bee documentary or two.
ENTER 
STRING From what I understand,
ENTER 
STRING doesn't your queen give birth
ENTER 
STRING to all the bee children?
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah, but...
ENTER 
STRING - So those aren't your real parents!
ENTER 
STRING - Oh, Barry...
ENTER 
STRING - Yes, they are!
ENTER 
STRING Hold me back!
ENTER 
STRING You're an illegitimate bee,
ENTER 
STRING aren't you, Benson?
ENTER 
STRING He's denouncing bees!
ENTER 
STRING Don't y'all date your cousins?
ENTER 
STRING - Objection!
ENTER 
STRING - I'm going to pincushion this guy!
ENTER 
STRING Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
ENTER 
STRING Oh, I'm hit!!
ENTER 
STRING Oh, lordy, I am hit!
ENTER 
STRING Order! Order!
ENTER 
STRING The venom! The venom
ENTER 
STRING is coursing through my veins!
ENTER 
STRING I have been felled
ENTER 
STRING by a winged beast of destruction!
ENTER 
STRING You see? You can't treat them
ENTER 
STRING like equals! They're striped savages!
ENTER 
STRING Stinging's the only thing
ENTER 
STRING they know! It's their way!
ENTER 
STRING - Adam, stay with me.
ENTER 
STRING - I can't feel my legs.
ENTER 
STRING What angel of mercy
ENTER 
STRING will come forward to suck the poison
ENTER 
STRING from my heaving buttocks?
ENTER 
STRING I will have order in this court. Order!
ENTER 
STRING Order, please!
ENTER 
STRING The case of the honeybees
ENTER 
STRING versus the human race
ENTER 
STRING took a pointed turn against the bees
ENTER 
STRING yesterday when one of their legal
ENTER 
STRING team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
ENTER 
STRING - Hey, buddy.
ENTER 
STRING - Hey.
ENTER 
STRING - Is there much pain?
ENTER 
STRING - Yeah.
ENTER 
STRING I...
ENTER 
STRING I blew the whole case, didn't I?
ENTER 
STRING It doesn't matter. What matters is
ENTER 
STRING you're alive. You could have died.
ENTER 
STRING I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
ENTER 
STRING They got it from the cafeteria
ENTER 
STRING downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
ENTER 
STRING Look, there's
ENTER 
STRING a little celery still on it.
ENTER 
STRING What was it like to sting someone?
ENTER 
STRING I can't explain it. It was all...
ENTER 
STRING All adrenaline and then...
ENTER 
STRING and then ecstasy!
ENTER 
STRING All right.
ENTER 
STRING You think it was all a trap?
ENTER 
STRING Of course. I'm sorry.
ENTER 
STRING I flew us right into this.
ENTER 
STRING What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
ENTER 
STRING just a couple of bugs in this world.
ENTER 
STRING What will the humans do to us
ENTER 
STRING if they win?
ENTER 
STRING I don't know.
ENTER 
STRING I hear they put the roaches in motels.
ENTER 
STRING That doesn't sound so bad.
ENTER 
STRING Adam, they check in,
ENTER 
STRING but they don't check out!
ENTER 
STRING Oh, my.
ENTER 
STRING Could you get a nurse
ENTER 
STRING to close that window?
ENTER 
STRING - Why?
ENTER 
STRING - The smoke.
ENTER 
STRING Bees don't smoke.
ENTER 
STRING Right. Bees don't smoke.
ENTER 
STRING Bees don't smoke!
ENTER 
STRING But some bees are smoking.
ENTER 
STRING That's it! That's our case!
ENTER 
STRING It is? It's not over?
ENTER 
STRING Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
ENTER 
STRING Get back to the court and stall.
ENTER 
STRING Stall any way you can.
ENTER 
STRING And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Flayman.
ENTER 
STRING Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
ENTER 
STRING Where is the rest of your team?
ENTER 
STRING Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
ENTER 
STRING Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
ENTER 
STRING and as a result,
ENTER 
STRING we don't make very good time.
ENTER 
STRING I actually heard a funny story about...
ENTER 
STRING Your Honor,
ENTER 
STRING haven't these ridiculous bugs
ENTER 
STRING taken up enough
ENTER 
STRING of this court's valuable time?
ENTER 
STRING How much longer will we allow
ENTER 
STRING these absurd shenanigans to go on?
ENTER 
STRING They have presented no compelling
ENTER 
STRING evidence to support their charges
ENTER 
STRING against my clients,
ENTER 
STRING who run legitimate businesses.
ENTER 
STRING I move for a complete dismissal
ENTER 
STRING of this entire case!
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
ENTER 
STRING to have to consider
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Montgomery's motion.
ENTER 
STRING But you can't! We have a terrific case.
ENTER 
STRING Where is your proof?
ENTER 
STRING Where is the evidence?
ENTER 
STRING Show me the smoking gun!
ENTER 
STRING Hold it, Your Honor!
ENTER 
STRING You want a smoking gun?
ENTER 
STRING Here is your smoking gun.
ENTER 
STRING What is that?
ENTER 
STRING It's a bee smoker!
ENTER 
STRING What, this?
ENTER 
STRING This harmless little contraption?
ENTER 
STRING This couldn't hurt a fly,
ENTER 
STRING let alone a bee.
ENTER 
STRING Look at what has happened
ENTER 
STRING to bees who have never been asked,
ENTER 
STRING "Smoking or non?"
ENTER 
STRING Is this what nature intended for us?
ENTER 
STRING To be forcibly addicted
ENTER 
STRING to smoke machines
ENTER 
STRING and man-made wooden slat work camps?
ENTER 
STRING Living out our lives as honey slaves
ENTER 
STRING to the white man?
ENTER 
STRING - What are we gonna do?
ENTER 
STRING - He's playing the species card.
ENTER 
STRING Ladies and gentlemen, please,
ENTER 
STRING free these bees!
ENTER 
STRING Free the bees! Free the bees!
ENTER 
STRING Free the bees!
ENTER 
STRING Free the bees! Free the bees!
ENTER 
STRING The court finds in favor of the bees!
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa, we won!
ENTER 
STRING I knew you could do it! High-five!
ENTER 
STRING Sorry.
ENTER 
STRING I'm OK! You know what this means?
ENTER 
STRING All the honey
ENTER 
STRING will finally belong to the bees.
ENTER 
STRING Now we won't have
ENTER 
STRING to work so hard all the time.
ENTER 
STRING This is an unholy perversion
ENTER 
STRING of the balance of nature, Benson.
ENTER 
STRING You'll regret this.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, how much honey is out there?
ENTER 
STRING All right. One at a time.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, who are you wearing?
ENTER 
STRING My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
ENTER 
STRING and I have no pants.
ENTER 
STRING - What if Montgomery's right?
ENTER 
STRING - What do you mean?
ENTER 
STRING We've been living the bee way
ENTER 
STRING a long time, 27 million years.
ENTER 
STRING Congratulations on your victory.
ENTER 
STRING What will you demand as a settlement?
ENTER 
STRING First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
ENTER 
STRING of all bee work camps.
ENTER 
STRING Then we want back the honey
ENTER 
STRING that was ours to begin with,
ENTER 
STRING every last drop.
ENTER 
STRING We demand an end to the glorification
ENTER 
STRING of the bear as anything more
ENTER 
STRING than a filthy, smelly,
ENTER 
STRING bad-breath stink machine.
ENTER 
STRING We're all aware
ENTER 
STRING of what they do in the woods.
ENTER 
STRING Wait for my signal.
ENTER 
STRING Take him out.
ENTER 
STRING He'll have nauseous
ENTER 
STRING for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
ENTER 
STRING And we will no longer tolerate
ENTER 
STRING bee-negative nicknames...
ENTER 
STRING But it's just a prance-about stage name!
ENTER 
STRING ...unnecessary inclusion of honey
ENTER 
STRING in bogus health products
ENTER 
STRING and la-dee-da human
ENTER 
STRING tea-time snack garnishments.
ENTER 
STRING Can't breathe.
ENTER 
STRING Bring it in, boys!
ENTER 
STRING Hold it right there! Good.
ENTER 
STRING Tap it.
ENTER 
STRING Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
ENTER 
STRING and there's gallons more coming!
ENTER 
STRING - I think we need to shut down!
ENTER 
STRING - Shut down? We've never shut down.
ENTER 
STRING Shut down honey production!
ENTER 
STRING Stop making honey!
ENTER 
STRING Turn your key, sir!
ENTER 
STRING What do we do now?
ENTER 
STRING Cannonball!
ENTER 
STRING We're shutting honey production!
ENTER 
STRING Mission abort.
ENTER 
STRING Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
ENTER 
STRING Returning to base.
ENTER 
STRING Adam, you wouldn't believe
ENTER 
STRING how much honey was out there.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, yeah?
ENTER 
STRING What's going on? Where is everybody?
ENTER 
STRING - Are they out celebrating?
ENTER 
STRING - They're home.
ENTER 
STRING They don't know what to do.
ENTER 
STRING Laying out, sleeping in.
ENTER 
STRING I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
ENTER 
STRING to San Antonio with a cricket.
ENTER 
STRING At least we got our honey back.
ENTER 
STRING Sometimes I think, so what if humans
ENTER 
STRING liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
ENTER 
STRING It's the greatest thing in the world!
ENTER 
STRING I was excited to be part of making it.
ENTER 
STRING This was my new desk. This was my
ENTER 
STRING new job. I wanted to do it really well.
ENTER 
STRING And now...
ENTER 
STRING Now I can't.
ENTER 
STRING I don't understand
ENTER 
STRING why they're not happy.
ENTER 
STRING I thought their lives would be better!
ENTER 
STRING They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
ENTER 
STRING Honey really changes people.
ENTER 
STRING You don't have any idea
ENTER 
STRING what's going on, do you?
ENTER 
STRING - What did you want to show me?
ENTER 
STRING - This.
ENTER 
STRING What happened here?
ENTER 
STRING That is not the half of it.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, no. Oh, my.
ENTER 
STRING They're all wilting.
ENTER 
STRING Doesn't look very good, does it?
ENTER 
STRING No.
ENTER 
STRING And whose fault do you think that is?
ENTER 
STRING You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
ENTER 
STRING Bees?
ENTER 
STRING Specifically, me.
ENTER 
STRING I didn't think bees not needing to make
ENTER 
STRING honey would affect all these things.
ENTER 
STRING It's notjust flowers.
ENTER 
STRING Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
ENTER 
STRING That's our whole SAT test right there.
ENTER 
STRING Take away produce, that affects
ENTER 
STRING the entire animal kingdom.
ENTER 
STRING And then, of course...
ENTER 
STRING The human species?
ENTER 
STRING So if there's no more pollination,
ENTER 
STRING it could all just go south here,
ENTER 
STRING couldn't it?
ENTER 
STRING I know this is also partly my fault.
ENTER 
STRING How about a suicide pact?
ENTER 
STRING How do we do it?
ENTER 
STRING - I'll sting you, you step on me.
ENTER 
STRING - Thatjust kills you twice.
ENTER 
STRING Right, right.
ENTER 
STRING Listen, Barry...
ENTER 
STRING sorry, but I gotta get going.
ENTER 
STRING I had to open my mouth and talk.
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa?
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
ENTER 
STRING Where are you going?
ENTER 
STRING To the final Tournament of Roses parade
ENTER 
STRING in Pasadena.
ENTER 
STRING They've moved it to this weekend
ENTER 
STRING because all the flowers are dying.
ENTER 
STRING It's the last chance
ENTER 
STRING I'll ever have to see it.
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
ENTER 
STRING I never meant it to turn out like this.
ENTER 
STRING I know. Me neither.
ENTER 
STRING Tournament of Roses.
ENTER 
STRING Roses can't do sports.
ENTER 
STRING Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
ENTER 
STRING Roses!
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa!
ENTER 
STRING Roses?!
ENTER 
STRING Barry?
ENTER 
STRING - Roses are flowers!
ENTER 
STRING - Yes, they are.
ENTER 
STRING Flowers, bees, pollen!
ENTER 
STRING I know.
ENTER 
STRING That's why this is the last parade.
ENTER 
STRING Maybe not.
ENTER 
STRING Could you ask him to slow down?
ENTER 
STRING Could you slow down?
ENTER 
STRING Barry!
ENTER 
STRING OK, I made a huge mistake.
ENTER 
STRING This is a total disaster, all my fault.
ENTER 
STRING Yes, it kind of is.
ENTER 
STRING I've ruined the planet.
ENTER 
STRING I wanted to help you
ENTER 
STRING with the flower shop.
ENTER 
STRING I've made it worse.
ENTER 
STRING Actually, it's completely closed down.
ENTER 
STRING I thought maybe you were remodeling.
ENTER 
STRING But I have another idea, and it's
ENTER 
STRING greater than my previous ideas combined.
ENTER 
STRING I don't want to hear it!
ENTER 
STRING All right, they have the roses,
ENTER 
STRING the roses have the pollen.
ENTER 
STRING I know every bee, plant
ENTER 
STRING and flower bud in this park.
ENTER 
STRING All we gotta do is get what they've got
ENTER 
STRING back here with what we've got.
ENTER 
STRING - Bees.
ENTER 
STRING - Park.
ENTER 
STRING - Pollen!
ENTER 
STRING - Flowers.
ENTER 
STRING - Repollination!
ENTER 
STRING - Across the nation!
ENTER 
STRING Tournament of Roses,
ENTER 
STRING Pasadena, California.
ENTER 
STRING They've got nothing
ENTER 
STRING but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
ENTER 
STRING Security will be tight.
ENTER 
STRING I have an idea.
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
ENTER 
STRING Official floral business. It's real.
ENTER 
STRING Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
ENTER 
STRING Thank you. It was a gift.
ENTER 
STRING Once inside,
ENTER 
STRING we just pick the right float.
ENTER 
STRING How about The Princess and the Pea?
ENTER 
STRING I could be the princess,
ENTER 
STRING and you could be the pea!
ENTER 
STRING Yes, I got it.
ENTER 
STRING - Where should I sit?
ENTER 
STRING - What are you?
ENTER 
STRING - I believe I'm the pea.
ENTER 
STRING - The pea?
ENTER 
STRING It goes under the mattresses.
ENTER 
STRING - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
ENTER 
STRING - I'm getting the marshal.
ENTER 
STRING You do that!
ENTER 
STRING This whole parade is a fiasco!
ENTER 
STRING Let's see what this baby'll do.
ENTER 
STRING Hey, what are you doing?!
ENTER 
STRING Then all we do
ENTER 
STRING is blend in with traffic...
ENTER 
STRING ...without arousing suspicion.
ENTER 
STRING Once at the airport,
ENTER 
STRING there's no stopping us.
ENTER 
STRING Stop! Security.
ENTER 
STRING - You and your insect pack your float?
ENTER 
STRING - Yes.
ENTER 
STRING Has it been
ENTER 
STRING in your possession the entire time?
ENTER 
STRING Would you remove your shoes?
ENTER 
STRING - Remove your stinger.
ENTER 
STRING - It's part of me.
ENTER 
STRING I know. Just having some fun.
ENTER 
STRING Enjoy your flight.
ENTER 
STRING Then if we're lucky, we'll have
ENTER 
STRING just enough pollen to do the job.
ENTER 
STRING Can you believe how lucky we are? We
ENTER 
STRING have just enough pollen to do the job!
ENTER 
STRING I think this is gonna work.
ENTER 
STRING It's got to work.
ENTER 
STRING Attention, passengers,
ENTER 
STRING this is Captain Scott.
ENTER 
STRING We have a bit of bad weather
ENTER 
STRING in New York.
ENTER 
STRING It looks like we'll experience
ENTER 
STRING a couple hours delay.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, these are cut flowers
ENTER 
STRING with no water. They'll never make it.
ENTER 
STRING I gotta get up there
ENTER 
STRING and talk to them.
ENTER 
STRING Be careful.
ENTER 
STRING Can I get help
ENTER 
STRING with the Sky Mall magazine?
ENTER 
STRING I'd like to order the talking
ENTER 
STRING inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
ENTER 
STRING Captain, I'm in a real situation.
ENTER 
STRING - What'd you say, Hal?
ENTER 
STRING - Nothing.
ENTER 
STRING Bee!
ENTER 
STRING Don't freak out! My entire species...
ENTER 
STRING What are you doing?
ENTER 
STRING - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
ENTER 
STRING - Who's an attorney?
ENTER 
STRING Don't move.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING Good afternoon, passengers.
ENTER 
STRING This is your captain.
ENTER 
STRING Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
ENTER 
STRING please report to the cockpit?
ENTER 
STRING And please hurry!
ENTER 
STRING What happened here?
ENTER 
STRING There was a DustBuster,
ENTER 
STRING a toupee, a life raft exploded.
ENTER 
STRING One's bald, one's in a boat,
ENTER 
STRING they're both unconscious!
ENTER 
STRING - Is that another bee joke?
ENTER 
STRING - No!
ENTER 
STRING No one's flying the plane!
ENTER 
STRING This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
ENTER 
STRING What's your status?
ENTER 
STRING This is Vanessa Bloome.
ENTER 
STRING I'm a florist from New York.
ENTER 
STRING Where's the pilot?
ENTER 
STRING He's unconscious,
ENTER 
STRING and so is the copilot.
ENTER 
STRING Not good. Does anyone onboard
ENTER 
STRING have flight experience?
ENTER 
STRING As a matter of fact, there is.
ENTER 
STRING - Who's that?
ENTER 
STRING - Barry Benson.
ENTER 
STRING From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa, this is nothing more
ENTER 
STRING than a big metal bee.
ENTER 
STRING It's got giant wings, huge engines.
ENTER 
STRING I can't fly a plane.
ENTER 
STRING - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
ENTER 
STRING - Yes.
ENTER 
STRING How hard could it be?
ENTER 
STRING Wait, Barry!
ENTER 
STRING We're headed into some lightning.
ENTER 
STRING This is Bob Bumble. We have some
ENTER 
STRING late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
ENTER 
STRING where a suspenseful scene
ENTER 
STRING is developing.
ENTER 
STRING Barry Benson,
ENTER 
STRING fresh from his legal victory...
ENTER 
STRING That's Barry!
ENTER 
STRING ...is attempting to land a plane,
ENTER 
STRING loaded with people, flowers
ENTER 
STRING and an incapacitated flight crew.
ENTER 
STRING Flowers?!
ENTER 
STRING We have a storm in the area
ENTER 
STRING and two individuals at the controls
ENTER 
STRING with absolutely no flight experience.
ENTER 
STRING Just a minute.
ENTER 
STRING There's a bee on that plane.
ENTER 
STRING I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
ENTER 
STRING and his no-account compadres.
ENTER 
STRING They've done enough damage.
ENTER 
STRING But isn't he your only hope?
ENTER 
STRING Technically, a bee
ENTER 
STRING shouldn't be able to fly at all.
ENTER 
STRING Their wings are too small...
ENTER 
STRING Haven't we heard this a million times?
ENTER 
STRING "The surface area of the wings
ENTER 
STRING and body mass make no sense."
ENTER 
STRING - Get this on the air!
ENTER 
STRING - Got it.
ENTER 
STRING - Stand by.
ENTER 
STRING - We're going live.
ENTER 
STRING The way we work may be a mystery to you.
ENTER 
STRING Making honey takes a lot of bees
ENTER 
STRING doing a lot of small jobs.
ENTER 
STRING But let me tell you about a small job.
ENTER 
STRING If you do it well,
ENTER 
STRING it makes a big difference.
ENTER 
STRING More than we realized.
ENTER 
STRING To us, to everyone.
ENTER 
STRING That's why I want to get bees
ENTER 
STRING back to working together.
ENTER 
STRING That's the bee way!
ENTER 
STRING We're not made of Jell-O.
ENTER 
STRING We get behind a fellow.
ENTER 
STRING - Black and yellow!
ENTER 
STRING - Hello!
ENTER 
STRING Left, right, down, hover.
ENTER 
STRING - Hover?
ENTER 
STRING - Forget hover.
ENTER 
STRING This isn't so hard.
ENTER 
STRING Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
ENTER 
STRING Barry, what happened?!
ENTER 
STRING Wait, I think we were
ENTER 
STRING on autopilot the whole time.
ENTER 
STRING - That may have been helping me.
ENTER 
STRING - And now we're not!
ENTER 
STRING So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
ENTER 
STRING All of you, let's get
ENTER 
STRING behind this fellow! Move it out!
ENTER 
STRING Move out!
ENTER 
STRING Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
ENTER 
STRING you copy me with the wings of the plane!
ENTER 
STRING Don't have to yell.
ENTER 
STRING I'm not yelling!
ENTER 
STRING We're in a lot of trouble.
ENTER 
STRING It's very hard to concentrate
ENTER 
STRING with that panicky tone in your voice!
ENTER 
STRING It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
ENTER 
STRING I can't do this!
ENTER 
STRING Vanessa, pull yourself together.
ENTER 
STRING You have to snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING You snap out of it.
ENTER 
STRING You snap out of it.
ENTER 
STRING - You snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING - You snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING - You snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING - You snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING - You snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING - You snap out of it!
ENTER 
STRING - Hold it!
ENTER 
STRING - Why? Come on, it's my turn.
ENTER 
STRING How is the plane flying?
ENTER 
STRING I don't know.
ENTER 
STRING Hello?
ENTER 
STRING Benson, got any flowers
ENTER 
STRING for a happy occasion in there?
ENTER 
STRING The Pollen Jocks!
ENTER 
STRING They do get behind a fellow.
ENTER 
STRING - Black and yellow.
ENTER 
STRING - Hello.
ENTER 
STRING All right, let's drop this tin can
ENTER 
STRING on the blacktop.
ENTER 
STRING Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
ENTER 
STRING No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
ENTER 
STRING Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING - Thinking bee.
ENTER 
STRING - Thinking bee.
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING Wait a minute.
ENTER 
STRING I think I'm feeling something.
ENTER 
STRING - What?
ENTER 
STRING - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
ENTER 
STRING Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
ENTER 
STRING Bring the nose down.
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING - What in the world is on the tarmac?
ENTER 
STRING - Get some lights on that!
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING - Vanessa, aim for the flower.
ENTER 
STRING - OK.
ENTER 
STRING Out the engines. We're going in
ENTER 
STRING on bee power. Ready, boys?
ENTER 
STRING Affirmative!
ENTER 
STRING Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
ENTER 
STRING Land on that flower!
ENTER 
STRING Ready? Full reverse!
ENTER 
STRING Spin it around!
ENTER 
STRING - Not that flower! The other one!
ENTER 
STRING - Which one?
ENTER 
STRING - That flower.
ENTER 
STRING - I'm aiming at the flower!
ENTER 
STRING That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
ENTER 
STRING I mean the giant pulsating flower
ENTER 
STRING made of millions of bees!
ENTER 
STRING Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
ENTER 
STRING Rotate around it.
ENTER 
STRING - This is insane, Barry!
ENTER 
STRING - This's the only way I know how to fly.
ENTER 
STRING Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
ENTER 
STRING flying in an insect-like pattern?
ENTER 
STRING Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
ENTER 
STRING Smell it. Full reverse!
ENTER 
STRING Just drop it. Be a part of it.
ENTER 
STRING Aim for the c 
!
ENTER 
STRING Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
ENTER 
STRING Come on, already.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, we did it!
ENTER 
STRING You taught me how to fly!
ENTER 
STRING - Yes. No high-five!
ENTER 
STRING - Right.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, it worked!
ENTER 
STRING Did you see the giant flower?
ENTER 
STRING What giant flower? Where? Of course
ENTER 
STRING I saw the flower! That was genius!
ENTER 
STRING - Thank you.
ENTER 
STRING - But we're not done yet.
ENTER 
STRING Listen, everyone!
ENTER 
STRING This runway is covered
ENTER 
STRING with the last pollen
ENTER 
STRING from the last flowers
ENTER 
STRING available anywhere on Earth.
ENTER 
STRING That means this is our last chance.
ENTER 
STRING We're the only ones who make honey,
ENTER 
STRING pollinate flowers and dress like this.
ENTER 
STRING If we're gonna survive as a species,
ENTER 
STRING this is our moment! What do you say?
ENTER 
STRING Are we going to be bees, orjust
ENTER 
STRING Museum of Natural History keychains?
ENTER 
STRING We're bees!
ENTER 
STRING Keychain!
ENTER 
STRING Then follow me! Except Keychain.
ENTER 
STRING Hold on, Barry. Here.
ENTER 
STRING You've earned this.
ENTER 
STRING Yeah!
ENTER 
STRING I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
ENTER 
STRING fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
ENTER 
STRING Oh, yeah.
ENTER 
STRING That's our Barry.
ENTER 
STRING Mom! The bees are back!
ENTER 
STRING If anybody needs
ENTER 
STRING to make a call, now's the time.
ENTER 
STRING I got a feeling we'll be
ENTER 
STRING working late tonight!
ENTER 
STRING Here's your change. Have a great
ENTER 
STRING afternoon! Can I help who's next?
ENTER 
STRING Would you like some honey with that?
ENTER 
STRING It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
ENTER 
STRING Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
ENTER 
STRING And I don't see a nickel!
ENTER 
STRING Sometimes I just feel
ENTER 
STRING like a piece of meat!
ENTER 
STRING I had no idea.
ENTER 
STRING Barry, I'm sorry.
ENTER 
STRING Have you got a moment?
ENTER 
STRING Would you excuse me?
ENTER 
STRING My mosquito associate will help you.
ENTER 
STRING Sorry I'm late.
ENTER 
STRING He's a lawyer too?
ENTER 
STRING I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
ENTER 
STRING All I needed was a briefcase.
ENTER 
STRING Have a great afternoon!
ENTER 
STRING Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
ENTER 
STRING and I can't get them anywhere.
ENTER 
STRING No problem, Vannie.
ENTER 
STRING Just leave it to me.
ENTER 
STRING You're a lifesaver, Barry.
ENTER 
STRING Can I help who's next?
ENTER 
STRING All right, scramble, jocks!
ENTER 
STRING It's time to fly.
ENTER 
STRING Thank you, Barry!
ENTER 
STRING That bee is living my life!
ENTER 
STRING Let it go, Kenny.
ENTER 
STRING - When will this nightmare end?!
ENTER 
STRING - Let it all go.
ENTER 
STRING - Beautiful day to fly.
ENTER 
STRING - Sure is.
ENTER 
STRING Between you and me,
ENTER 
STRING I was dying to get out of that office.
ENTER 
STRING You have got
ENTER 
STRING to start thinking bee, my friend.
ENTER 
STRING - Thinking bee!
ENTER 
STRING - Me?
ENTER 
STRING Hold it. Let's just stop
ENTER 
STRING for a second. Hold it.
ENTER 
STRING I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
ENTER 
STRING Can we stop here?
ENTER 
STRING I'm not making a major life decision
ENTER 
STRING during a production number!
ENTER 
STRING All right. Take ten, everybody.
ENTER 
STRING Wrap it up, guys.
ENTER 
STRING I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
